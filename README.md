## 💡 About the Project

**Futuristic Calculator** is not just a calculator. It’s an all-in-one advanced mathematical engine built for engineers, students, scientists, and everyday users who want more from their calculator.

It includes:
- 🧠 Instant evaluation of complex expressions
- 📊 Real-time **graph plotting** (2D & 3D)
- 🌡️ **Unit conversions** (temperature, length, etc.)
- 🎤 **Voice input** using speech recognition
- 🌙 Light/Dark mode toggle
- 📚 Scientific calculator features (log, trig, sqrt, factorial, etc.)

Designed with a modern UI and voice-activated intelligence, it sets a new benchmark for what a calculator can be.

## 🧩 Features

| Feature                | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| 💬 Voice Input          | Perform calculations or open modules with your voice |
| 🧪 Scientific Calculator| Trig, log, ln, power, factorial, root, and more |
| 📈 Graph Plotting       | Plot multiple curves and view in 2D/3D |
| 🔄 Unit Converter       | Convert between different units like °C to °F, cm to inch, etc. |
| 🎨 Dark/Light Themes    | Switch between modes for better visibility |
| 🖱️ UI Buttons Animation | Interactive and visually responsive UI |

## 🛠️ How It Works

### ▶️ Launching the App
Run it via Python:
```bash
python main.py
```

### 🎤 Voice Commands Supported
- "Switch to graph"
- "Switch to unit converter"
- "Show scientific mode"
- "Switch to dark mode"
- "Calculate 25 divided by 5 plus log 100"
- "Stop voice"

### 📉 Graph Module
- Plot multiple expressions like: `sin(x)`, `cos(x*2)`
- Color picker, zoom, pan, export

### 🔁 Unit Converter
- Convert values like: `100 cm to inches`, `37 C to F`
